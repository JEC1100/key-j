# Key-J app

Key-J is an app to help DJs, musicians and music enthusiasts access a song's key information, such as danceability, energy, mood, tempo, time signature and, of course, key.

It was concepted and built by [Isobel Peppiatt](https://github.com/isobelpepp), [Matt Firmston](https://github.com/YoFirmy), [Luke Usher](https://github.com/lushcodes), [James Condon](https://github.com/JEC1100) and [Pav Rao](https://github.com/pav0107) as their final project at Makers.


## Set-up

This project works in two parts: the front end is stored in the client folder, and the back end is stored in server folder. Once the project has been forked/cloned, each will need to be set up individually.

The back end runs on Node.js and first needs dependencies to be installed. First cd into server folder and then run:

```
npm install
```

Then cd into client folder and repeat this step by, again, running:

```
npm install
```

### Using the Spotify API

1. Visit [Spotify For Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/).
2. Go to the dashboard and click 'log in'.
3. Create an app. 
4. Make a note of the CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET
5. Go back to your project's folder on your computer and add a .env file in your server folder.
6. Add another .env folder in server/src/api
7. In both of these add the following:
```
CLIENT_ID = <em>YOUR CLIENT ID</em>
CLIENT_SECRET = <em>YOUR CLIENT SECRET</em>
PORT = 3001
```

## Run servers

First cd into server folder and then run:

```
npm start
```

### Server tests

End to end tests are included in the server side. This means that you have to run the servers first (see [Run Servers](#run-servers)) in a seperate window/tab in your command line)

Tests use the Jest testing framework. To see the tests, run:

```
npm test
```

If you want to see the test coverage, alongside the tests, run:

```
npm test -- --coverage
```

Linting is handled by ESLint and run automatically with the tests. If you want to run linting without the tests run:

```
npm run pretest
```
